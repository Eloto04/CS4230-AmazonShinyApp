# Shiny App - Amazon product co-purchasing network

This is our group submission for CS 4230.

To run the Shiny app, you will need to have the Python library `shiny` installed. If you have not installed this yet, run `pip install shiny` in the terminal.

To run the app, run `python -m shiny run --reload app.py` in the terminal. You should then be able to access the app in your web browser using `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.
